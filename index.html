      <p>I am a lecturer in mathematics at the University of Stirling in Scotland.</p>
      <p>
        My undergraduate studies took place at the University of St Andrews in Scotland from 2010-2014.
        This consisted of a balance of pure and applied mathematics,
        focusing on real and abstract analysis, measure theory and fractal geometry from the pure division,
        and a mixture of dynamical systems, scientific programming and solar magnetohydrodynamics on the applied side.
        My senior honours project was supervised by Prof Lars Olsen, on the uniform distribution of sequences.
        During 2012, I was also the treasurer of the St Andrews University Christian Union.
      </p>
      <p>
        I undertook my doctorate in the School of Computing at Ulster University under
        the supervision of Dr Mark McCartney and Dr David Glass. This concerned the modelling and simulation of complex ecological systems,
        particularly eco-evolutionary models of the emergence of communities and meta-communities of species.
        The outcomes from these investigations can be found on my <a href="main/publications.html">publications</a> page.
      </p>
      <p>
        Shortly before defending my thesis in 2018, I was appointed to a lectureship at Sheffield Hallam University in Sheffield, England.
        My role in engineering mathematics was primarily to instruct undergraduates on our various engineering degree pathways
        (particularly Railway Engineering) in the requisite mathematical, statistical and computational techniques that such disciplines require.
        During the first two years of this appointment, I completed a PGCTHE and consequently attained Fellowship of the Higher Education Academy,
        and following my second year in the role (and profession) I was one of twenty-two members of staff across the university to receive an Inspirational Teaching Award on the basis of nomination by my students.
        As we are all well-aware, education changed drastically in 2020, and in the autumn of that year I recorded almost 200 short videos for lecture series in undergraduate engineering mathematics.
        For the year 2021-22, I progressed to Senior Lecturer and was one of the university's Early Career Research and Innovation Fellows, to conduct research around the modelling and simulation
        of population dynamics on complex networks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since September 2022, I have been employed by the University of Stirling as a lecturer in mathematics. I currently conduct research on computational ecological modelling, and lecture on
        topics in introductory pure and applied mathematics.
